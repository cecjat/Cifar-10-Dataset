# CIFAR-10 Dataset
#### Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels) across 10 different classes. Each class contains 6,000 images, making CIFAR-10 a well-established benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Originally created by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton, this dataset serves as a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.

#### Classes
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of the following classes:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

#### Usage
Researchers and practitioners commonly use CIFAR-10 to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms and models in image classification tasks. Due to its relatively small size and diverse set of classes, CIFAR-10 provides a challenging yet manageable dataset for experimenting with various techniques in computer vision.
